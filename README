My html file for the Bryn Mawr pdf - tips for making accessible scans. 
At this point I have a general outline but I cannot figure out proper image placement.
I do not know how to show this in browser mode to you as I am new to html but possibly if you copied and pasted the code into your broswer you could view it?
The only thing I am having trouble with is the images, because I know there is a Bryn Mawr logo at the bottom so I am not sure how to add those.
Please give me feedback wherever works best for you, if you would like to email me my email is mmstevens@brynmawr.edu and I would be willing to meet if you would like to.
Thank you so much.
